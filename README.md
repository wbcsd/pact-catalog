## 5. Open a Pull Request

Go to the original [pact-catalog repository](https://github.com/sine-fdn/pact-catalog), choose the `Pull requests` tab and click the `New pull request` button.
Open a Pull Request to merge the branch `<your-name>` from your forked repository into the `main` branch of the `pact-catalog` repository. Instructions on how to open Pull Requests accross forks can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

<strong>Please note:</strong> All text between angle brackets (`< >`) should be replaced by actual values. Please make sure that the values replacing `<your-name>`, `<extenion-id>`, `<extension-version>`,`<your-solution-id>`, and `<your-solution-version>` remain consistent. None should contain whitespaces and `<your-solution-version>` should follow the `X.Y.Z` format.

Your Pull Request will be reviewed and your solution added to the PACT Online Catalog as soon as possible.

> **_NOTE:_** Conformance test results are shown in the `Conformance` tab of a specific solution's page. If the tested solution has not yet been added to the catalog, the test data will not be visible. Rest assured, however, that it is included in the catalog and will become visible as soon as the tested solution is added.
