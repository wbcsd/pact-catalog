# Contribute a PACT Conforming Solution

To contribute a PACT Conforming Solution, please follow these steps:

> **_NOTE:_** The following steps pressupose that you have already forked and cloned the `pact-catalog` repository. If that is not the case, please go back to the [main instructions](/README.md) and follow them in order.

### 1. Create a new solution path in the `solutions` directory

From the parent directory of your local repository run

```sh
mkdir -p catalog/solutions/<your-solution-id>/<your-solution-version>
```

### 2. Create a new `json` file in your solution's directory

From the parent directory of your local repository run

```sh
touch catalog/solutions/<your-solution-id>/<your-solution-version>/solution.json
```

### 3. Fill in your solution's details

Open the `json` file created in step 4. and fill it by adapting the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "<your-solution-id>",
  "name": "<your-solution-name>",
  "version": "<your-solution-version>",
  "website": "<your-solution-website>",
  "provider": "<your-name>",
  "summary": "<summary>"
}
```

Note: The `"summary"` field is optional but highly recommended.

If your solution supports Industry Specific Extensions, please include also the field `"extensions"`, based on the following structrue:

```json
  "extensions": [
    { "namespace": "@<your-name>",
    "extension_name": "<extension-id>",
    "version": "<extension-version>" },
  ],
```

If your solution was conceived to be used in specific industries — and especially if it supports Industry Specific Extensions — please include the field `"industries"`, based on the following structure:

```json
  "industries": ["<industry>"],
```

Please refer to [this example](./catalog/solutions/steel-industry-solution/1.0.0/solution.json) to see how your `solution.json` file should look like.

### 4. Contribute a Conformance Test Result

> **_NOTE:_** If your solution has not yet been tested for conformance, please skip this step.

If have already tested your solution for conformance with the Pathfinder Framework, please contribute a <strong>Conformance Test Result</strong> by following [these instructions](./CONTRIB_TEST.md).

### 5. Commit your branch, push it, and open a Pull Request

Please continue from [step 4 of the main instructions](/README.md#4-commit-and-push-your-branch).

<strong>Please note:</strong> All text between angle brackets (`< >`) should be replaced by actual values. Please make sure that the values replacing `<your-name>`, `<your-solution-id>` and `<your-solution-version>` remain consistent. None should contain whitespaces and `<your-solution-version>` should follow the `X.Y.Z` format.

Your Pull Request will be reviewed and your solution added to the PACT Online Catalog as soon as possible.

> **_NOTE:_** By submitting a Conforming Solution you acknowledge that you have read and accepted the Catalog's [Terms and Conditions](/catalog/legal/TERMSANDCONDITIONS.md).
